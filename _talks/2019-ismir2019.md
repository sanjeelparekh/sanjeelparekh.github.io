This tutorial provides an introduction to tools, techniques and applications for audiovisual processing in music information retrieval. Two case studies aimed to provide the participants with a hands-on experience in this area. I was fortunate to be a part of this tutorial that was jointly delivered with Zhiyao Duan, Slim Essid and Bochen Li.
