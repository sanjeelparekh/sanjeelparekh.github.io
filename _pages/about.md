I am a postdoctoral research engineer at Telecom Paris. I recently defended my PhD on [learning representations for robust audio-visual scene analysis](https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02115465). I was advised by a wonderful team of researchers from Telecom Paris and Technicolor, France: [Slim Essid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5dP_Pv0AAAAJ&hl=en), [Gael Richard](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xn70tPIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Alexey Ozerov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LnV-0z0AAAAJ&hl=en), [Ngoc Duong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-_dcJlEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Patrick Perez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8Cph5uQAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Through these pages, I wish to share work that I do and if possible, other content/ideas that I find engaging in areas of interest such as research, music, philosophy, etc. Hope you enjoy it!
