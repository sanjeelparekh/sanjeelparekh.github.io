I am a postdoctoral researcher working with [Prof. Florence d'Alch√©-Buc](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-qbL7z0AAAAJ&hl=en) at Telecom Paris. Prior to this, I was part of a tech-transfer project aimed towards designing an exciting audio scene analysis product! I defended my PhD on [learning representations for robust audio-visual scene analysis](https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02115465) in March 2019. I was advised by a wonderful team of researchers from Telecom Paris and Technicolor, France: [Slim Essid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5dP_Pv0AAAAJ&hl=en), [Gael Richard](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xn70tPIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Alexey Ozerov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LnV-0z0AAAAJ&hl=en), [Ngoc Duong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-_dcJlEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Patrick Perez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8Cph5uQAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Through these pages, I wish to share work that I do and if possible, other content/ideas that I find engaging in areas of interest such as multimedia & ML research, music, philosophy, etc. Hope you enjoy it!
