I am currently working as a research scientist at Meta Reality Labs Research. Prior to this, I did audio and ML research at Audio Analytic and Telecom Paris.  My doctoral thesis involved [learning representations for robust audio-visual scene analysis](https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02115465).

Through these pages, I wish to share work that I do and if possible, other content/ideas that I find engaging in areas of interest such as multimedia & ML research, music, philosophy, etc. Hope you enjoy it!
