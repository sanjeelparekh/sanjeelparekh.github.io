I am a postdoctoral research engineer at Telecom Paris. I recently defended my PhD on [learning representations for robust audio-visual scene analysis](https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02115465) done through an industrial collaboration between Telecom Paris and Technicolor R&I. I was advised by a wonderful team of researchers: Slim Essid, Gael Richard, Alexey Ozerov, Ngoc Duong and Patrick Perez. 

Through these pages, I wish to share work that I do and if possible, other content/ideas that I find engaging in areas of interest such as research, music, philosophy, etc. Hope you enjoy it!
