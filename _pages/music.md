I grew up learning North Indian Classical vocals and thanks to stay at different residential schools and universities, I had the opportunity to learn from several teachers and friends various aspects of Indian and other music styles. I acknowledge them below, in chronological order:

- Pramod Kishan Sir, Ramdev ji (Vocals, Jodhpur)
- Nikhil Kshirsagar Sir, Tulika Akka (Vocals, Sahyadri-Pune)
- Telang Sir, Dani Sir (Tabla, Sahyadri-Pune)
- Srinivasan Sir (Mridangam, Rishi Valley, Chittoor)
- Shri Kundanmal ji (Vocals, Jaipur)
- Mostafa (Western music basics and Violin, Rennes)
